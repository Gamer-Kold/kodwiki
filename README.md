# kodwiki
A minimalist tiddlywiki spin for productivity and knowledge management.

This wiki is what I've comfied up into as I (re) set up a proper workspace for knowledge management. The main motivator behind the overhaul is that I tried Obsdian for a little while and while I didn't end up sticking with it; it's design choices made me reconsider my approach to knowledge management.

## Features
* Autocompletion of tiddler titles
* A self-written writing inbox that uses spaced repitition (written completely in wikitext to prove a point)
* Contexual Backlinks; so you can see the relationships between your notes in context.
* A kanban board for project management

And probably some other stuff that I have forgotten about.

## Points to Note
* This is very much intended to be used as nodejs wiki; it doesn't _have_ to be. But several design choices become less _convincing_ in a single file envorment. Such as, for example, the Markdown by default philosophy; intended to make export to other software easier, doesn't really help in a single file wiki.
* Dark palletes don't really play well with Muuri; which makes the default story layout and the kanban boards; well retina-searing. I don't really have a problem with this as SolarizedLight, Blue and DesertSand are more than dark enough to not sear my retinas while still working well with Muuri.
