This Tiddlywiki spin uses Evidently Cube's Auto Complete plug-in to provide auto completion.

In text entry typing "[[" , "[](" or "#" brings up an autocompletion menu. Out of these three options, the latter two only produce valid links for Markdown, and the first one only produces valid links for wiki text.

It is recommended for the least amount of suprises to use "#" for auto completion needs most of the time.
