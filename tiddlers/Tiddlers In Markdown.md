In KodWiki, by default the New Tiddler button is missing from the Side Bar. Replaced instead by the New Markdown Tiddler button. 

This is mostly for wiki archival purposes; wikitext is a format exclusive to TiddlyWiki, Markdown has a lot wider support when it comes to stuff outside TiddlyWiki. It also makes export to other software easier. This matters less if you aren't running your tiddlywiki as a nodejs server but it's still worth considering. As far as I can tell; there are no downsides to using markdown; even widgets work just fine.
